# Hawkes-Process

This project was part of my course at TÉLÉCOM PARIS named Continuous time Markov Chains and martingales. Here, we study the Hawkes process which is a self-exciting point process for which the arrival rate of events depends on past events. Hawkes process can model several phenomena, for example, we can use it to simulate arrival times of cyberattacks threatening a company as presented in this [article](https://hal.science/hal-02546343).
